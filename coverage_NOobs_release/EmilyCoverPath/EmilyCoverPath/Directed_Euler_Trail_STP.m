%% Given an UNDIRECTED graph, G, this function constructs a DIRECTED Graph 
%  representing an Euler Tour from the input graph (assuming that the graph 
%  has the properties needed for the Euler processing). The graph is returned 
%  in the variable GEuler.  The flag "exists" is false (0)
%  if no tour exists, or true (1) if a tour exists.  This code is based on 
%  Fleury's algorithm, which is relatively easy to understand, but is not
%  as efficient as Hierholzer's algorithm.  MATLAB's mediocre method for
%  representing graphs also makes this code inefficient and funky.
